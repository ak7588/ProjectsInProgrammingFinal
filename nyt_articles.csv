And if that was true, he feared, the outbreak might already be approaching pandemic potential. “The respiratory viruses we tote around like that are the ones that don’t knock us on our asses — they don’t put us in bed before we start shedding them,” Shaman told me recently. “Viruses like that can be nearly impossible to control.” ",2021-11-22T10:00:13+0000,News
